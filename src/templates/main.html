                <p>Our most important currency is trust. This is as true today as when CP Scott marked the centenary of the founding of the Guardian
                    with his famous essay on journalism in 1921. The purpose of this code is, above all, to protect and foster the bond of trust between GNM (in print and online) and its readers, and therefore to protect the integrity of GNM and its journalism, however it is published. As a set of guidelines this will not form part of a journalist’s contract of employment, nor will it form part, for either editorial
                    management or journalists, of disciplinary, promotional or recruitment procedures. However, by observing the code, journalists working for GNM will be protecting the independence, standing andreputation of themselves and their colleagues. It is important thatfreelancers also abide by these guidelines while on assignment for GNM.

                <h4>Press Complaints Commission Code of Practice</h4>
                <p>GNM – in common with most news publishers in Britain – considers the PCC’s Code of Practice to be a sound statement of ethical behaviour for journalists. It is written into our terms of employment that staff should adhere to the Code of Practice. It is published below so that all editorial staff can familiarise themselves with it — and comments in this document that relate to the PCC Code are marked with an asterisk.</p>

                <h4>A | Anonymous quotations</h4>
                <p>We recognise that people will often speak more honestly if they are allowed to speak anonymously. The use of non-attributed quotes can therefore often assist the reader towards a truer understanding of a subject than if a journalist confined him/herself to quoting bland on-the-record quotes. But if used lazily or indiscriminately anonymous quotes become a menace. We should be honest about our sources, even if we can’t name them. The New York Times policy on pejorative quotes is worth bearing in mind: “The vivid language of direct quotation confers an unfair advantage on a speaker or writer who hides behind the newspaper, and turns of phrase are valueless to a reader who cannot assess the source.” There may be exceptional circumstances when anonymous pejorative quotes may be used, but they will be rare — and only after consultation with the senior editor of the day. In the absence of specific approval we should paraphrase anonymous pejorative quotes.</p>
                <div class="line2"></div>
                <h4>B | Anonymous contributions</h4>
                <p>Articles commissioned by GNM should be published anonymously or pseudonymously only in exceptional circumstances, for example where the author's safety, privacy or livelihood may be compromised, and only with the permission of the relevant editor or managing editor. In these cases, readers should be made aware that identities have been obscured or withheld. This provision need not apply to user-generated content published or reproduced on our print and digital platforms, or to authors with established pseudonyms commissioned or hosted by GNM in that capacity.</p>
                <div class="line2"></div>
                <h4>C | Credits</h4>
                <p>Staff must not reproduce other people’s material without attribution, other than in exceptional circumstances – for example where the source cannot be identified — and only with permission of the most senior editor on duty. The source of published material obtained from another organisation should be acknowledged, including quotes taken from other newspaper articles. Bylines should be carried only on material that is substantially the work of the bylined journalist. If an article contains a significant amount of agency copy then the agency should be credited.</p>
                <div class="line2"></div>
                <h4>Bribery and facilitation payments</h4>
                <p>The Bribery Act 2010 takes a robust approach to bribery, and creates a number of criminal offences, which even if committed abroad can be prosecuted in the UK. These include (i) bribery - ie offering someone in the UK or abroad a financial or other advantage to improperly perform an activity (whether public or private), (ii) being bribed and (iii) bribing a foreign public official. In some circumstances, offers or acceptances of hospitality and / or facilitation payments paid to public officials abroad in order to secure or expedite the performance of a routine or necessary action will come within the  Act. There is no public interest defence, although where an individual is left with no alternative but to make a facilitation payment in order to protect against loss of life, limb or liberty there may be a defence of duress. Staff should always discuss with their managing editor beforehand if they are concerned that any payments might fall into these categories and, if such payments are requested or made, they should inform the editor-in-chief or their managing editor of the circumstances as soon as they are able to afterwards.

                <h4>Children *</h4>
                <p>Special care should be taken when dealing with children (under the age of 16). Heads of departments must be informed when children have been photographed or interviewed without parental consent. Articles that include significant intrusions into children's private lives without their understanding and consent need a strong public interest justification.</p><p>In view of the longevity of online material, editors should consider whether children's identities should be obscured to protect them from embarrassment or harm as they grow older.</p><p>These provisions extend to writers who are considering making their own children the subject of an article. Consent to publication should be sought where the child is reasonably considered able to make an informed decision.</p><p>Section 6 of the PCC code should be studied carefully.</p>

                <h4>Commissioning</h4>
                <p>GNM supports good commissioning practice, including fair treatment of freelances. Editorsshould make reference to the GNM’s Freelance Charter when commissioning new contributors. See: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/guardian-news-media-freelance-charter">http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/guardian-news-media-freelance-charter</a></p>

                <h4>Copy approval</h4>
                <p>The general rule is that no one should be given the right to copy approval. In certain circumstances we may allow people to see copy or quotes but we are not required to alter copy. We should avoid offering copy approval as a method of securing interviews or co-operation.</p>
                <div class="line2"></div>
                <h4>Copyright</h4>
                <p>Journalists should not use content from non-authorised third-party sources - whether pictures, textor other media - without obtaining the necessary permissions. There are limited legal situations wherepermission may not be needed but you must check with the picture desk or editorial legal before using withoutpermission. Journalists should especially familiarise themselves with the guidelines on “rights and use ofcontent from public websites”, available on GNM's internal Really Social Media site on Spike.</p>
